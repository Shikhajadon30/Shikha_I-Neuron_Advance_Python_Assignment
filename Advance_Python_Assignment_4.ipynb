    "Question:- Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-Method overloading is a way where we add new functionality to an already defined function, and in that way, we overload the function. There are many other languages that support method overloading, and Python also supports method overloading. For example, the plus operator is an example of operator overloading where it can add integers as well as strings. Then the minus operator who can subtract integers, as well sets, lists also so, that’s how Python has overloading features in its operator and functions.\n",

    "Suppose the user has two objects which are the physical representation of a user-defined data type class. The user has to add two objects using the \"+\" operator, and it gives an error. This is because the compiler does not know how to add two objects. So, the user has to define the function for using the operator, and that process is known as \"operator overloading\". The user can overload all the existing operators by they cannot create any new operator. Python provides some special functions, or we can say magic functions for performing operator overloading, which is automatically invoked when it is associated with that operator. Such as, when the user uses the \"+\" operator, the magic function __add__ will automatically invoke in the command where the \"+\" operator will be defined."
