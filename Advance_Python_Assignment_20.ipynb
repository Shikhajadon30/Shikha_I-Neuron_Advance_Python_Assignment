    "Float is Approximate-number data type, which means that not all values in the data type range can be represented exactly , it round up the values.\n",

    "1) Decimal( Precision, Scale)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, Precision Means the total number of digits, both before and after the decimal point. The precision has a range from 1 to 38. The default precision is 38.\n",
    "\n",
    "and Scale is the number of digits after the decimal point.Scale can only be specified if Precision is specified. The scale must always be less than or equal to the precision.\n",

    "2)Float(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the n indicates if the field will take up 4 or 8 bytes. The float data type supports values in these ranges -1.79E+308 to -2.23E-308, 0 and 2.23E-308 to 1.79E+308.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of characters in the scientific notation of the value is between 1 to 24 the precision is 7 digits and the storage is 4 bytes. If the number of characters in the scientific notation of the value is between 25 to 53 the precision is 15 digits and the storage is 8 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Float is a single precision (32 bit) floating point data type and decimal is a 128-bit floating point data type.\n",
    "Floating point data type represent number values with fractional parts.\n",
    "Decimal accurately represent any number within the precision of the decimal format, whereas Float cannot accurately represent all numbers.\n",
    "Decimal used within financial applications that require a high degree of accuracy and easy to avoid rounding errors whereas Float used when you stores scientific numbers and for better performance.\n",

However, it is possible to use Python’s comparison operators to compare a Decimal instance x with another number y. This avoids confusing results when doing equality comparisons between numbers of different types."
