    "Answer:-In Python, list slicing is a common practice and it is the most used technique for programmers to solve efficient problems.

    "Question:-Q5. What happens if one of the slicing expression's indexes is out of range?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Answer:-Python slicing means to access a subsequence of a sequence type using the notation [start:end]. A little-known feature of slicing is that it has robust end indices. Slicing is robust even if the end index is greater than the maximal sequence index. The slice just takes all elements up to the maximal element. If the start index is out of bounds as well, it returns the empty slice.\n",
    "Indexing is supposed to always return one single element. Slicing is supposed to return a subsequence of a variable number of elements. If you index a non-existent element, there’s nothing to return and Python must throw an error—everything else wouldn’t make any sense. But if you slice an out-of-bounds sequence, it makes perfect sense to return an empty sequence."

    "    \n",
    "Answer:-List comprehensions are powerful tools for processing such structures because they automatically scan rows and columns for us. For example, though this structure stores the matrix by rows, to collect the second column we can simply iterate across the rows and pull out the desired column. We can also iterate through positions in the rows and index as we go:\n",

    "\n",
    "We typically should use simple for loops when getting started with Python, and map. Use comprehension where they are easy to apply. However, there is a substantial performance advantage to use list comprehension. The map calls are roughly twice as fast as equivalent for loops. List comprehensions are usually slightly faster than map calls. This speed difference is largely due to the fact that map and list comprehensions run at C language speed inside the interpreter. It is much faster that stepping through Python for loop code within the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for loops make logic more explicit, we may want to use them on the grounds of simplicity. On the other hand, map and list comprehensions are worth knowing and using for simpler kinds of iterations if the speed of application is an important factor.\n",
