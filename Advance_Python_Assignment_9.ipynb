    "    \n",
    "Answer:- We can provide the entire regular expression pattern by overriding the class attribute pattern. If you do this, the value must be a regular expression object with four named capturing groups. The capturing groups correspond to the rules given above, along with the invalid placeholder rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "escaped – This group matches the escape sequence, e.g. $$, in the default pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "named – This group matches the unbraced placeholder name; it should not include the delimiter in capturing group.\n",
    "\n",
    "braced – This group matches the brace enclosed placeholder name; it should not include either the delimiter or braces in the capturing group.\n",
    "\n",
    "invalid – This group matches any other delimiter pattern (usually a single delimiter), and it should appear last in the regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "flags – The regular expression flags that will be applied when compiling the regular expression used for recognizing substitutions. The default value is re.IGNORECASE. Note that re.VERBOSE will always be added to the flags, so custom idpatterns must follow conventions for verbose regular expressions."

In IBM® SPSS® Modeler, Python scripts are assumed to be encoded in UTF-8, which is a standard Unicode encoding that supports non-ASCII characters. The following script will compile because the Python compiler has been set to UTF-8 by SPSS Modeler.\n",

    "Text files are used to store data more user friendly. Binary files are used to store data more compactly. In the text file, a special character whose ASCII value is 26 inserted after the last character to mark the end of file. In the binary file no such character is present.\n"

    "Answer:- Unicode encodings UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32?\n",
    "We now know that Unicode is an international standard that encodes every known character to a unique number. Then the next question is how do we move these unique numbers around the internet? You already know the answer! Using bytes of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "UTF-8: It uses 1, 2, 3 or 4 bytes to encode every code point. It is backwards compatible with ASCII. All English characters just need 1 byte — which is quite efficient. We only need more bytes if we are sending non-English characters.\n",
