    "Answer:-A class is a blueprint that is needed to make an object(= instance). The difference between an object and an instance is, an object is a thing and an instance is a relation. In other words, instance describes the relation of an object to the class that the object was made\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class, and may be called a class instance or class object; instantiation is then also known as construction. Not all classes can be instantiated – abstract classes cannot be instantiated, while classes that can be instantiated are called concrete classes.\n",

    "Answer:-Python uses dictionaries to store class and instance variables. Class variables share the same dictionary across all instances of the class, and instance variables are stored in a unique dictionary per instance. The class dict is stored in <class>. __dict__ , and this is referenced on an instance with <obj>.\n",

    "Question:-Q4. What exactly is a method, and how is it different from a regular function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-A method in python is somewhat similar to a function, except it is associated with object/classes. Methods in python are very similar to functions except for two major differences. The method is implicitly used for an object for which it is called. The method is accessible to data that is contained within the class.\n",

    "Question:-Q6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.\n",

    "Answer:-self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self”  we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments.\n",
    "The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the @ syntax to refer to instance attributes.

    "\n",
    "The Python __radd__() method implements the reverse addition operation that is addition with reflected, swapped operands. So, when you call x + y, Python attempts to call x.__add__(y).

    "If this fails, Python tries to fix it by calling the y.__radd__() for reverse addition on the right operand y.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reverse addition method is implemented, Python knows that it doesn’t run into a potential problem of a non-commutative operation. If it would just execute y.__add__(x) instead of x.__add__(y), the result would be wrong because the operation may be non-commutative when defined as a custom operation. That’s why y.__radd__(x) is needed.\n",
