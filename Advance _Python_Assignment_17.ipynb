    "as possible. What is the bare minimum effort required to transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy\n",
    "one? What characters or characters can you introduce or change?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-A greedy quantifier such as ?, *, +, and {m,n} matches as many characters as possible (longest match). For example, the regex 'a+' will match as many 'a's as possible in your string 'aaaa'—even though the substrings 'a', 'aa', 'aaa' all match the regex 'a+'.\n",
    "A non-greedy quantifier such as ??, *?, +?, and {m,n}? matches as few characters as possible (shortest possible match). For example, the regex 'a+?' will match as few 'a's as possible in your string 'aaaa'. Thus, it matches the first character 'a' and is done with it.\n",
    "In other words, the non-greedy quantifiers give you the shortest possible match from a given position in the string.\n",
    "So the difference between the greedy and the non-greedy match is the following: The greedy match will try to match as many repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible. The non-greedy match will try to match as few repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible.\n",
