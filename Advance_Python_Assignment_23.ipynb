    "\n",
    "Answer:-When to Use :-\n",
    "A Line graph - Line graphs are used to track changes over short and long periods of time. When smaller changes exist, line graphs are better to use than bar graphs. Line graphs can also be used to compare changes over the same period of time for more than one group.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Pie Chart - Pie charts are best to use when you are trying to compare parts of a whole. They do not show changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bar Graph - Bar graphs are used to compare things between different groups or to track changes over time. However, when trying to measure change over time, bar graphs are best when the changes are larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Area Graph - Area graphs are very similar to line graphs. They can be used to track changes over time for one or more groups. Area graphs are good to use when you are tracking the changes in two or more related groups that make up one whole category (for example public and private groups).\n",
    "\n",
    "An X-Y Plot - X-Y plots are used to determine relationships between the two different things. The x-axis is used to measure one event (or variable) and the y-axis is used to measure the other. If both variables increase at the same time, they have a positive relationship. If one variable decreases while the other increases, they have a negative relationship. Sometimes the variables don't follow any pattern and have no relationship."

    "Question:-Q2. Can you explain the benefit of compound interest over a higher rate of interest that does not\n",
    "compound after reading this chapter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-Compound interest is the interest on a deposit calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Or, more simply put, compound interest is interest you earn on interest . You can compound interest on different frequency schedules such as daily, monthly or annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the number of compounding periods, the greater the compounded interest. Think about it like a snowball. The sooner you start saving, and the more money you add to your snowball, the larger it will grow. Now, think about if you pushed the snowball down a snow-covered hill. Now the snow you already packed will stay, and you’ll accumulate more snow. Eventually, when your snowball reaches the bottom of the hill, it will contain the snow you started with, the snow it picked up along the way, and even more snow on top of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the interest-on-interest effect can generate continually increasing returns based on your initial investment amount. So, the more frequently you save, and the larger the amount you save, will return larger amounts of interest. This is also called “the miracle of compound interest.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is compound interest important?\n",
    "Compound interest causes your wealth to grow faster. It makes a sum of money grow at a faster rate than simple interest because you will earn returns on the money you invest, as well as on returns at the end of every compounding period. This means that you don’t have to put away as much money to reach your goals!\n",
    "\n",
    "The magic of compounding can be an important factor when building your wealth. The earlier you open an interest-bearing account and start stocking away money, the more money you will earn in compound interest. It’s also key to helping mitigate wealth-eroding factors like the rising cost of living, inflation, and reduction of purchasing power."

    "A histogram is the best way to visualize the frequency distribution of a dataset by splitting it into small equal-sized intervals called bins.
