    "\n",
    "Answer:-Classes may generate instances (objects), and have per-instance state (instance variables). Modules may be mixed in to classes and other modules. The mixed in module's constants and methods blend into that class's own, augmenting the class's functionality. Classes, however, cannot be mixed in to anything."

    "\n",
    "Answer:-To perform operator overloading, Python provides some special function or magic function that is automatically invoked when it is associated with that particular operator. For example, when we use + operator, the magic method __add__ is automatically invoked in which the operation for + operator is defined."

    "\n",
    "Answer:-The operator overloading in Python means provide extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. Such as, we use the \"+\" operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is overloaded by the \"int\" class and \"str\" class."
