    "Question:- 1.What is the purpose of Python&#39;s OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:- Object-Oriented Programming makes the program easy to understand as well as efficient. Since the class is sharable, the code can be reused. Data is safe and secure with data abstraction. Polymorphism allows the same interface for different objects, so programmers can write efficient code."

    "\n",
    "Answer:-The whole point of a namespace tool like the class statement is to support name inheritance. In Python, inheritance happens when an object is qualified, and involves searching an attribute definition tree (one or more namespaces). Every time you use an expression of the form object."

    "Answer:-The first argument of every class method, including init, is always a reference to the current instance of the class. By convention, this argument is always named self. In the init method, self refers to the newly created object; in other class methods, it refers to the instance whose method was called."

    "\n",
    "Answer:-The __init__ method is the Python equivalent of the C++ constructor in an object-oriented approach. The __init__ function is called every time an object is created from a class. The __init__ method lets the class initialize the object's attributes and serves no other purpose. It is only used within classes."

Superclasses are sometimes called ancestors as well. There exists a hierarchical relationship between classes."
