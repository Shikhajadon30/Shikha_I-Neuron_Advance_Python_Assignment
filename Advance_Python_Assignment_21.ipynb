    "Question:-Q2. Is there a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers, if there is\n",
    "one? Why are the latter considered “good enough”?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-The difference between true random number generators(TRNGs) and pseudo-random number generators(PRNGs) is that TRNGs use an unpredictable physical means to generate numbers (like atmospheric noise), and PRNGs use mathematical algorithms (completely computer-generated).\n",
    "Pseudo-RNG's are sets of algorithms (i.e. logical instructions for by a computer program) that utilize mathematical formulas to produce a certain sequence of numbers that will appear random, or at least will have the effect of randomness. Other RNG's use pre-calculated tables instead of mathematical formulas, but either way table or formula, the objective is still the same.\n",
    "A lot of research has been done (and is still ongoing) on RNG's insomuch that our modern algorithms used for Pseudo-RNG's produce number sequences that do exactly mimic truly random sequences. But that may be the outcome of today's research there is still room for improvement since the results of Pseudo-RNG's are really \"pseudo\".\n",
    "Comparing the results of a Pseudo-RNG with that from a True-RNG will prove useful. If you list down the results of a Pseudo-RNG mimicking dice rolls the numbers will really appear as if they are random. But statistical analysis will prove that the numbers produced by a Pseudo-RNG is not really random but is rather predetermined. Thus its results can be measured and standardized, and, we can say, controlled.\n",
    "True-RNG's behave differently since the results are truly random and unpredictable. If we try to get a computer to produce a really random sequence of numbers then the computer must base its numbers on a naturally occurring physical phenomenon, which may include the radioactive decay of isotopes, static in the airwaves, and the waves of the sea. True-RNG's will not really be cost-efficient if you compare it to Pseudo-RNG's. True-RNG's will be subject to wear and tear since all things natural will really be subject to entropy. A Pseudo-RNG will not be subject to such physical phenomena.\n",
    "Another efficiency of a Pseudo-RNG is that you can reproduce the same sequence of numbers in another time by simply knowing the starting point of the sequence (thus it is also periodic and the sequence will repeat itself in due time). This better facilitates inspections done by casino control boards. But you can be sure that the sequence of numbers produced by a Pseudo-RNG, though periodic, the time to reproduce the same sequence will eventually take a really long time that unless you acquire the actual algorithms, the correct sequence will be very difficult (almost impossible) to crack.\n",
    "Many online casinos have settled for Pseudo-RNG's for its cost-efficiency, periodicity, and efficiency. These are good reasons to choose this type of random number generator, though a True-RNG will also have its own benefits as well."

    "Question:-Q3. What are the two main factors that influence the behaviour of a &quot;normal&quot; probability distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-The two main parameters of a (normal) distribution are the mean and standard deviation. The parameters determine the shape and probabilities of the distribution. The shape of the distribution changes as the parameter values change.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean\n",
    "The mean is used by researchers as a measure of central tendency. It can be used to describe the distribution of variables measured as ratios or intervals. In a normal distribution graph, the mean defines the location of the peak, and most of the data points are clustered around the mean. Any changes made to the value of the mean move the curve either to the left or right along the X-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Standard Deviation\n",
    "The standard deviation measures the dispersion of the data points relative to the mean. It determines how far away from the mean the data points are positioned and represents the distance between the mean and the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the graph, the standard deviation determines the width of the curve, and it tightens or expands the width of the distribution along the x-axis. Typically, a small standard deviation relative to the mean produces a steep curve, while a large standard deviation relative to the mean produces a flatter curve."

    "Answer:- Income Distribution In Economy:- The income of a country lies in the hands of enduring politics and government. It depends upon them how they distribute the income among the rich and poor community. We all are well aware of the fact that the middle-class population is a bit higher than the rich and poor population. So, the wages of the middle-class population makes the mean in the normal distribution curve.\n",

    "Rolling A Dice:-A fair rolling of dice is also a good example of normal distribution. In an experiment, it has been found that when a dice is rolled 100 times, chances to get ‘1’ are 15-18% and if we roll the dice 1000 times, the chances to get ‘1’ is, again, the same, which averages to 16.7% (1/6). If we roll two dices simultaneously, there are 36 possible combinations. The probability of rolling ‘1’ (with six possible combinations) again averages to around 16.7%, i.e., (6/36). More the number of dices more elaborate will be the normal distribution graph."

    "happen as the number of trials grows?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range. This range will be bounded between the minimum and maximum possible values, but precisely where the possible value is likely to be plotted on the probability distribution depends on a number of factors. These factors include the distribution's mean (average), standard deviation\n",
    "Perhaps the most common probability distribution is the normal distribution, or \"bell curve,\" although several distributions exist that are commonly used. Typically, the data generating process of some phenomenon will dictate its probability distribution. This process is called the probability density function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability distributions can also be used to create cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), which adds up the probability of occurrences cumulatively and will always start at zero and end at 100%.\n",
    "Since the fractional width decreases with increasing N, the number of outcomes for which there is an appreciable probability becomes a smaller and smaller fraction of all possible outcomes as the number of trials increases."

Python’s x % y returns a result with the sign of y instead, and may not be exactly computable for float arguments. For example, fmod(-1e-100, 1e100) is -1e-100, but the result of Python’s -1e-100 % 1e100 is 1e100-1e-100, which cannot be represented exactly as a float, and rounds to the surprising 1e100.
