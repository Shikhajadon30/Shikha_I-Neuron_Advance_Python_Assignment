    "__getattr__ gets called if there is no attribute in the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s invoked “last”, if Python can’t find that attribute.(lowest priority)\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattribute__ gets called all the times, whether there is the attribute or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s invoked “first”(highest priority) — it actually “intercepts” every lookup.\n",
    "\n",

    "Question:-Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-descriptors are a low-level mechanism that lets you hook into an object's attributes being accessed. Properties are a high-level application of this; that is, properties are implemented using descriptors. Or, better yet, properties are descriptors that are already provided for you in the standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a simple way to return a computed value from an attribute read, or to call a function on an attribute write, use the @property decorator. The descriptor API is more flexible, but less convenient, and arguably \"overkill\" and non-idiomatic in this situation. It's useful for more advanced use cases, like implementing bound methods, or static and class methods; when you need to know, for example, if the attribute was accessed through the type object, or an instance of the type."

    "properties and descriptors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-A key difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__ is that __getattr__ is only invoked if the attribute wasn't found the usual ways. It's good for implementing a fallback for missing attributes, and is probably the one of two you want.\n",

    "By Properties, We can bind getter, setter (and deleter) functions with an attribute name, using the built-in property function. When we do this, each reference to an attribute looks like simple, direct access, but invokes the appropriate function of the object. For example, anObject.price= someValue; anObject.value.\n",

    "By Descriptors, We can bind getter, setter (and deleter) functions into a separate class. We then assign an object of this class to the attribute name.
