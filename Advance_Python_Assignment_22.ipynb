    "Question:-Q1. What are the benefits of the built-in array package, if any?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-Built-in array module defines an object type which can efficiently represent an array of basic values: characters, integers, floating point numbers. Arrays are sequence types and behave very much like lists, except that the type of objects stored in them is constrained. \n",
    "This means objects stored in the array are of a homogeneous(same) type. Type of objects to be stored in an array (built-in) is determined by typecode. Type codes are single characters.\n",
    "In array module “array(typecode [, initializer])” returns an array. Where initializer is optional, and if provided it must be a list, string or iterable.\n",

    "An array which is formed will be homogeneous. That is, in an integer array only integer values can be stored, while in a float array only floating value and character array can have only characters. Thus, no array can have values of two data types.\n",

    "Question:-Q3. Describe the main differences between the array and numpy packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-Numpy (Links to an external site.) is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. A numpy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers. The number of dimensions is the rank of the array; the shape of an array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.\n",

    "Size - Numpy data structures take up less space\n",
