    "Question:- 1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Answer:-An abstract superclass is one way to provide re-usable code. We can extend the abstract class and inherit the code. This is sometimes more convenient than using static methods or object composition to share code. The abstract class can \"fix\" parts of the code (by making it final)."

That is, pass the self instance to the superclass version of the method manually:Superclass.method(self,...)."

    "\n",
    "Answer:- Local variables have Function Scope: They can only be accessed from within the function. Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions. Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.\n",
    "\n",
