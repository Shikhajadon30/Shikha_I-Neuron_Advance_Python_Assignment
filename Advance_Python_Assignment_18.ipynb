    "\n",
    "There are mainly two types of data files — text file and binary file. A text file consists of human readable characters, which can be opened by any text editor. On the other hand, binary files are made up of non-human readable characters and symbols, which require specific programs to access its contents."

In other words, it's the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream to store it in a file/database, maintain program state across sessions, or transport data over the network.he pickled byte stream can be used to re-create the original object hierarchy by unpickling the stream.\n",

The shelf object defined in this module is dictionary-like object which is persistently stored in a disk file. This creates afile similar to dbm database on UNIX like systems.
